## Pull Requests

We're using the Git Flow workflow within our projects. So every change is done via Pull Request.

Make sure that you have checked the following points before you set your Pull Request to be ready for review:

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Increase the version number in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is Semantic Versioning
