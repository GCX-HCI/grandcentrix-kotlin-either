## Pull Requests

We're using the Git Flow workflow within our projects. So every change is done via Pull Request.

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is Semantic Versioning.
